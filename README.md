# Vue School App
This web app was designed and built as an assignment for the Web & Mobile Full Stack course @ Odisee Hogeschool Gent.
The assignment required the users to split the solution into 1 repo for the [backend (Laravel)](https://github.com/DownesL/vue-school-app-backend) and 1 repo for the frontend (Vue).
